Final Project - Face detection for videos
year: 2020

RUN faceDetection.m : apply the face detection algorithm videoFaceDetection.m and analyse the results

NB: 1) AlexNetRetrained.mat was to big for the upload, to test it it is necessary to re-train the network.
   
    2) I used Adam Sandlers' sequence and stored it as "Sandler.mp4" in a folder called "video". (default values)

    3) In faceDetection.m it is possible to change the various parameters and inputs of the algorithm (including the video to be analyzed)
